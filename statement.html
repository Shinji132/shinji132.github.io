<h1> Artist Statement </h1>
<p>The reason that I make my work is that I need to find something that motivates me to give me that boost to start. The material that I use is that I do most of my work online as I mainly use programs that I am given. It connects to the outside world due to the fact that I gain motivation by looking around my surroundings. I don’t often gain motivation when I am alone, I often get motivation through seeing others work pieces. I play around with the program a lot trying to jog my imagination, likewise most of the pieces I have made are just me messing around and playing around with the tools and seeing what I can create. I do this because it helps me express myself in ways that I have not been able to do before. It gives me an outlet to express how I feel and stuff like that.</p>
<p>My process of making art pieces is that I mess around until I find something that clicks with me. I tend to play around a lot with the program and then see what looks good or not. A good example is the video project I did when I was recording my friends driving. We were just messing around and then I would just sit on the road recording them drive by me. Like I said above, it is just me to just have fun with friends and to express myself in ways I couldn’t before.</p>
