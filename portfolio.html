     <h3>Shibuya x Luminous</h3>
     <p>In this video I took videos of my friends cars taking off while we were just in a parking lot
grabbing food. I then got the idea of recording them drive off because they had to go places after we grabbed food..</p>

     <p>This was a project that I made with my group mate, we weren’t really going for much other than the fact that we were messing around. I ended up just messing around with the picture in audacity.</p>

     <p>While designing this website I tried to lay it out in the order of game genre’s that I switched too. I first started off playing First Person Shooters and then I switched to MOBA’s, I then went to racing games and lastly I stopped at MMORPGS.</p>

     <p>This piece my group decided to use the Time Square and I was just trying to put stuff in that would somehow fit in as if it was part of the actual picture. I was just messing around as I put waldo somewhere in the picture and I put the Joker in the billboard.</p>

            <h3>San Jose Sharks</h3>
            <p>This video I recorded myself in the bar in San Pedro Square. The basis of the video is that I made a bet with my aunt and everytime we scored I got hyped up because I was winning the bet. I lost my voice in the 2nd period. </p>
